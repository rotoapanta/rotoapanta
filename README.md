Nice to meet you! My name is Roberto. I'm currently working as a IOT architect in [ToGuBrainSolutions] (togubrain.tk/). I previously worked on building an open source telecommunications system monitoring system as a full-stack developer. Nowadays, I am working on ToGuBRAIN Solutions Platform as a developer of applications for agriculture, transportation, intelligent parking, disaster monitoring.
