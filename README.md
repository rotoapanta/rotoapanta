Nice to meet you! My name is Roberto. I'm currently studying and working as a [IOT architect](https://devdegree.ca/) in @ToGuBrainSolutions. I previously worked on building the [Shopify Fulfillment Network](https://www.shopify.com/fulfillment) as a fullstack developer. Nowadays, I am working on ToGuBRAIN Solutions Platform as a developer of applications for agriculture, transportation, intelligent parking, disaster monitoring.
